## About Ichibytes

<!-- TODO: Add after deployment -->
<!-- This portfolio is hosted on [üåê https://ichibytes.dev](https://ichibytes.dev). -->

Ichibytes is a personal portfolio showcasing my work as a Software Engineer. It is built using React and Next.js, and it is self-hosted. The domain name was inspired by my love for Japanese culture and the word "_ichiban_", which means "_number one_" or "_the best._" I strive to be the best software engineer I can be, and I hope to share my passion for coding with others through my projects.
